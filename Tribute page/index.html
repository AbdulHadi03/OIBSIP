        <h1>Founder of FaceBook</h1>
        <p>
          Facebook is a social networking service originally launched as
          TheFacebook on February 4, 2004, before changing its name to simply
          Facebook in August 2005.It was founded by Mark Zuckerberg and college
          roommates and fellow Harvard University students, in particular
          Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris
          Hughes.The website's membership was initially limited by the founders
          to Harvard students, but was expanded to other colleges in the Boston
          area, the Ivy League,and gradually most universities in the United
          States and Canada, corporations, and by September 2006, to everyone
          with a valid email address along with an age requirement of being 13
          or older.<br />
          On October 1, 2005, Facebook expanded to twenty-one universities in
          the United Kingdom and others around the world. Facebook launched a
          high school version in September 2005, which Zuckerberg called the
          next logical step. At that time, high school networks required an
          invitation to join. Facebook later expanded membership eligibility to
          employees of several companies, including Apple Inc. and Microsoft. On
          December 11, 2005, universities in Australia and New Zealand were
          added to the Facebook network, bringing its size to 2,000+ colleges
          and 25,000+ high schools throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico,
          the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland. Facebook was
          then opened on September 26, 2006, to everyone aged 13 and older with
          a valid email address.

        <h1>Life Story</h1>
        <p>
          Mark Zuckerberg, born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, is
          an American computer programmer and Internet entrepreneur who
          co-founded Facebook. Raised in Dobbs Ferry, New York, Zuckerberg
          showed an early aptitude for programming. At the age of 12, he created
          a messaging program called "Zucknet" for his family's home network.
          His talents eventually led him to Harvard University, where he
          launched "The Facebook" in 2004, a social networking site that quickly
          gained popularity among students. The success of Facebook propelled
          Zuckerberg into the forefront of the tech industry, and by the time he
          dropped out of Harvard in 2005, the platform had expanded beyond
          college campuses and become a global phenomenon. <br />As the CEO of
          Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg played a pivotal role in the company's
          growth, overseeing various acquisitions and innovations. Despite
          facing controversies related to user privacy and the spread of
          misinformation on the platform, Zuckerberg has remained a prominent
          figure in the technology world. In addition to his work with Facebook,
          he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have engaged in philanthropy,
          pledging to donate a significant portion of their wealth to various
          charitable causes through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Mark
          Zuckerberg's life story reflects the transformative impact of
          technology on society and his role in shaping the digital landscape.
